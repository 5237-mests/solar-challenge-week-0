## ✅ Task 1: Git & Environment Setup (Summary)

For Task 1, I successfully set up both version control and the Python development environment. Key steps included:

- **Git & Repository Setup:**

  - Installed Git and configured user credentials.
  - Created a new public repository on GitHub.
  - Cloned the repo locally and initialized it with essential files.
  - Used the `main` branch for all initial commits and tracked changes with descriptive commit messages.

- **Python Environment:**
  - Installed Python 3.x.
  - Created a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`.
  - Activated the environment and installed required packages using `pip`.
  - Used **VS Code** and **Jupyter Notebook** as development tools.

## ✅ Task 2: Approach to Data Profiling, Cleaning & EDA

The following approach was taken to explore and prepare the dataset for analysis:

- **Data Profiling:**

  - Loaded the dataset using `pandas`.
  - Used methods like `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.head()`, and `.isnull().sum()` for basic insights.
  - Optionally used `pandas-profiling` for automated report generation.

- **Data Cleaning:**

  - Handled missing values through removal or imputation (mean/median as appropriate).
  - Removed duplicate rows and corrected any inconsistent data entries.
  - Ensured proper data types for each column and standardized column names.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Planned and created visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
  - Explored distributions with histograms and box plots.
  - Checked relationships using scatter plots and correlation heatmaps.
  - Focused on identifying patterns and anomalies in the data relevant to the solar energy context.
